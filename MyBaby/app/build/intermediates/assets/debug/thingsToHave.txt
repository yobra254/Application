If you're planning to give birth at home, discuss your plans and what you need to prepare with your midwife. Think about where in your home you want to give birth. You're likely to need:
clean linen and towels
clothes (including a hat) and nappies for the baby
about 24 super-absorbent sanitary towels
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Important numbers</font>
<br>
<br>
Wherever you're planning to give birth, keep a list of important numbers in your handbag or near the phone. You need to include:
your hospital or midwife's phone number
your partner or birth partner's phone number
your own hospital reference number, which is on your card or notes (you will be asked for this when you phone in)
If you don't have a phone, ask neighbours if you can use theirs when the time comes.
Some hospitals and midwifery units allow you to use your mobile phone. Check with your midwife. If you can't use your mobile phone, make sure you have a phonecard or change for a payphone.

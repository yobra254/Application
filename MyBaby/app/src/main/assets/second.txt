During the next 3 months of your pregnancy you will probably put on about 6 kilograms, even though your unborn baby will only weigh about 1 kilogram by the end of this part of your pregnancy. The other weight will be in the placenta, your uterus, breasts and extra blood.
During this 3 month period some tests may be done, especially if you are over 35 or there is a family medical problem.
You will probably also have an ultrasound scan to check on your baby's growth and health.
You will need to go to regular antenatal checkups with your doctor or midwife.
Many women find that they feel great during this stage of their pregnancy. Much of the tiredness and morning sickness of the first trimester is behind you, and your baby is not yet so big that you are feeling exhausted from carrying it around.
Remember to continue being careful with your diet, exercise, look after yourself and rest as much as possible.

Hair and nails
Many women find that their hair is thicker during pregnancy - this is because not so many hairs fall out during the pregnancy. If this happens for you, you will notice that you lose more hair than usual two or three months after your baby is born, until your hair returns to normal.
Some women also find that their fingernails become stronger and grow more quickly, while others find that their fingernails become softer and break more than usual. These changes are probably caused by changes in hormone levels during pregnancy.

Food cravings
Around eight out of 10 pregnant women experience cravings for at least one particular food. Some crave sweet foods while others want more salty snacks, spicy foods or fatty foods.
Between 50 and 80 per cent also find that they want to avoid some foods they previously enjoyed - they may find that the smell of some foods become unbearable.

Some women find their nose becomes blocked up and sometimes bleeds for no obvious reason. This is a common problem during pregnancy and is probably because of pregnancy hormones, which cause the delicate nasal membranes to soften and swell.

If your nose does become blocked, try not to blow it too hard, as this can cause nosebleeds. Many over the counter cold medicines are not suitable to use during pregnancy but some nasal spray products may be useful (check with your pharmacist to see which are best during pregnancy). Steam inhalations can be a good alternative for clearing your nose.

Some women get a stitch-like pain down one side of their abdomen. This is because your uterine ligaments are stretching as your uterus is enlarging.

During this last 3 months of pregnancy, you may be worried or anxious about labour and wish for the time before the birth to go quickly.
You will probably gain about 5 kilograms during this stage. Much of this weight will be from your baby, but you will also gain extra weight from the amniotic fluid, the placenta, your breasts, blood and your uterus.
You will need to have more frequent antenatal checkups during this time - about 4 weekly until 36 weeks, then 2 weekly after that. Your doctor or midwife will continue to monitor your progress to make sure all is going well.
Problems which can make your life uncomfortable at this stage may include back pain, difficulty getting comfortable enough to sleep, and pressure on your lungs from the baby.
You may get more Braxton Hicks contractions - tightenings of the muscles of the uterus. They last about half a minute, are irregular and not painful. They are not a sign of labour starting.
You will probably begin to feel quite tired.

You probably feel as though the baby is pushing against all your internal organs. This is because your uterus is pushing up against your diaphragm, stomach, liver and intestines. 

Some women stop work around this time because they start to feel more tired.

Pregnancy hormones have been softening your ligaments. The combination of this and your baby's increasing weight can cause problems with backache. It's therefore really important to maintain good posture when you are standing or sitting. Try putting a cushion behind the small of your back when you are sitting. Take care when lifting, and it can be better to avoid wearing high heels from now on.

You may start to feel breathless at times because the baby is pushing up against your lungs, particularly when you are sitting. This feeling is normal and does not mean that you or your baby is getting less oxygen.

Many babies will begin to settle into a head-down position in the uterus. This is because the top part of the uterus is larger and allows more room for the biggest part of the baby, which is baby's bottom and bent up legs. At this stage the baby still has plenty of room to move around in the uterus and the position is not important.

You will begin to feel your baby's movements more as prods and kicks and you may even be able to tell the difference between a foot, knee or your baby's bottom.

At your checkups, the doctor or midwife will check on the growth of your baby and ask if your baby is moving or kicking regularly. 

It is important that you rest as much as you can with your feet elevated, especially if you have swelling in your feet or ankles. From now on you should avoid lying flat on your back because in this position the weight of the baby and the uterus place pressure on major blood vessels and may cause you to feel faint.

You may find that you need to urinate (pass water) more often as your baby's head is pushing on your bladder. When you laugh, sneeze or cough, you may lose a small amount of urine. It is important that you do pelvic floor tightening exercises, as these will help you control your bladder more quickly after the baby is born. If you don't know how to do pelvic floor exercises, your doctor or midwife can teach you.

Physiotherapists also have a range of exercises for the pelvic floor. If you go to antenatal education classes these will be explained. It is important to do these exercises for the rest of your life.

Your baby's head may begin to move down or engage into your pelvis about this time. You will find that breathing is easier once your baby's head is engaged, as your baby's bottom will no longer be pressing up against your lungs.

Around 4 in every 100 babies remain in the breech position at the end of the pregnancy. A breech position means the baby has the bottom down instead of the head. If your baby stays in this position some doctors may attempt to turn the baby to a head down position for the birth. If the baby cannot be turned, your doctor may recommend that the birth be by acCaesarean section. Have a look at the topic 'Breech position and delivery'.

Your pattern of sleep may be troubled and you may find it hard to get comfortable in bed. It might be helpful to use pillows between your knees and to support your abdomen as you lie on your side.

Your baby may be moving a little less now as there is less space to move and instead of whole body movements, you may only notice jabs from their foot or knee. You may also feel a sensation inside your vagina as your baby's head is moving against your pelvic floor muscles.

YouYour cervix is softening in readiness for labour. You may also be experiencing quite strong Braxton Hicks contractions. You may be feeling very heavy and weary and just waiting for the baby to hurry up and arrive.

Although your due date has arrived remember that your labour may begin one or two weeks either side of this date.

<font color="#ffffff">Week 13</font>
<br>
Your baby is now fully formed and looks like a tiny human being. Most of your baby's internal organs are working.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 14</font>
<br>
Your baby now has eyebrows and a small amount of hair on his or her head and measures about 12 cm long. Babies get all of their nourishment from the placenta they also drink some of the amniotic fluid around them and can pass urine.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 15</font>
 <br>

The hair on your baby's head and eyebrows is becoming coarser. If your baby has an inherited (genetic) tendency for dark hair, pigment is now forming in hair follicles.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 16</font>
<br>
A fine downy hair (called lanugo) begins to form over a baby's body and they will begin to develop eyelashes. At this stage, babies may even find and suck their thumb! Your baby is now about 16 cm long and weighs about 135 g.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 17</font>
<br>
Your growing baby has now pushed up the top of your uterus and this can be felt between your pubic bone and navel. From now on, your baby weighs more than the placenta (the afterbirth).
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 18</font>
<br>
Your baby will now be about 19 cm long and weigh about 170 g. Your baby is able to kick, grasp and suck.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 19</font>
<br>
Your baby's first teeth are developing in the gums and so are the buds for permanent teeth.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 20</font>
<br>
Your baby's skin begins to form a white, waxy coating called vernix. The vernix clings to the lanugo (the fine downy hair) all over your baby's skin, to protect it and hold in moisture.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 21</font>
<br>
Your baby weighs about 340 g and is moving around freely within the amniotic fluid in your uterus.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 22</font>
<br>
Your baby is now about 25cm long and would fit into your cupped hands.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 23</font>
<br>
Your baby is now forming a pattern of activity and sleep, and this may be different from yours! Your baby may be more active when you want to sleep.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 24</font>
<br>
Your baby is rapidly growing now and their internal organs are all formed and mature, except for the lungs. If your baby was born at this stage it may be mature enough to have a chance of survival in a neo-natal intensive care unit.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 25</font>
<br>
Same as week 24
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 26</font>

<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 27</font>
<br>
Your baby's skin is starting to change from being transparent (see-through) to opaque (can't see through). It is very wrinkled, but protected and nourished by the covering of vernix.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 28</font>
Your baby is now about 38 cm long, weighs around 900g. At this antenatal check-up, your doctor or midwife will check the size of your baby and can often feel certain body parts, such as head, bottom and limbs.

<font color="#ffffff">Week 3</font>
<br>

During week 3 the fertilised egg burrows into the lining of your uterus and is the size of a full stop.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 4</font>
<br>

Specialised layers of cells are beginning to develop, which will form your baby's vital organs, nervous system, bones, muscles and blood.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 5</font>
<br>

At week 5, your baby is about 2 mm long. Your baby's spine, brain, muscles and bone are already starting to form
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 6</font>
<br>

By the end of this week, your baby (called an embryo) has a heartbeat. Blood is pumping around the baby and out along the umbilical cord to the placenta. The placenta is an organ that acts as a filter. It allows oxygen and nutrients to pass to the embryo, and carbon dioxide and waste products to be eliminated. The placenta is also called the afterbirth.

Your baby's head and body are now defined and tiny buds appear where arms and legs will develop. Your baby is now about 6 mm long - about the length of a grain of rice.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 7</font>
<br>

Your baby's spinal cord and brain are developing and your baby lies within a sac of membranes and is supported by fluid known as amniotic fluid. Nostrils and lips now appear on your baby's face and the eyes can be seen under the skin.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 8</font>
<br>

The baby now looks more human - your baby's limbs can be seen and hands and feet are taking shape ï¿½ all this amazing growth, yet your baby is now around just 1.3 cm long!
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 9</font>
<br>

At the end of this week, your baby is now called a fetus, not an embryo. The limbs are growing quickly and the fingers and toes are forming. Your baby's skeleton, which started as cartilage, is now changing to bone.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 10</font>
<br>

Your baby is now about 2.5 cm long and has tiny fingers and toes
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 11</font>
<br>

Your baby's internal organs are now all formed - including ovaries or testicles.
<br>
<br>
<font color="#ffffff">Week 12</font>
<br>

Your baby's head is becoming more rounded and the eyelids have formed and closed over the eyes. You still can't feel it, but your baby is moving around constantly in your amniotic fluid - your baby can now roll, stretch, yawn and wriggle fingers.
<br>
From this stage on your baby's heartbeat may be able to be heard with a fetal heart detector.
